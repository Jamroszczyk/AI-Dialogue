# AI-Dialogue
AI Dialogue is anapp where two configurable AI agents speak to each other out loud while you observe the conversation in real time. Provide a short system prompt (up to 500 characters) for each agent, press Go, and the app orchestrates an alternating dialogue with low‑latency text‑to‑speech playback.
